            <h2>History of Paco Park</h2>
            <p>Paco Park was originally established in the late 19th century as a cemetery for the Spanish elite. It was the burial site of notable figures, including the national hero, Dr. José Rizal, before his remains were transferred to Rizal Park. In the 1970s, Paco Park was transformed into a public park, preserving its historical significance while providing a serene space for relaxation and cultural activities. Today, it serves as a venue for various events, including weddings and concerts.</p>
