            <h2>History of Rizal Park</h2>
            <p>Rizal Park, also known as Luneta Park, is one of the most iconic and historically significant landmarks in the Philippines. Named after the national hero, Dr. José Rizal, the park is the site where he was executed by Spanish colonial authorities on December 30, 1896, sparking greater resistance that led to the Philippine Revolution. Established in the early 20th century, Rizal Park has since become a symbol of Filipino nationalism and a place for public gatherings and celebrations.</p>
