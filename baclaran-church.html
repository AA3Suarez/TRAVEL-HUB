            <h2>History of Baclaran Church</h2>
            <p>Baclaran Church, officially known as the National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help, is one of the most visited Marian shrines in the Philippines. Its origins date back to 1932 when the Redemptorist priests began promoting devotion to Our Mother of Perpetual Help. The church gained prominence after World War II and has become a center for spiritual devotion, especially during the popular “Baclaran Day” every Wednesday when thousands of devotees gather for the novena.</p>

On Wednesdays and during Marian feast days, expect large crowds. Dress modestly and be mindful of the church’s customs. Be prepared for traffic and limited parking in the area, so arriving early is recommended.</p>
